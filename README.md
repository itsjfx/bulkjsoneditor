# jsoneditor
bulk json editor in Python made for editing ASF configs

# Usage
* MOVE ANY CONFIGS YOU WANT TO CHANGE OUT OF YOUR MAIN CONFIG FOLDER (DO NOT PUT ASF.JSON IN THERE)
* IT IS RECOMMENDED YOU BACKUP YOUR ORIGINALS
* Edit the keys in the py script and run  
* It's worth noting that Python will rearrange the keys as JSONs are supposed to have unordered mappings (http://stackoverflow.com/a/4920304/42973)
